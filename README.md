# ticket-thing

For years I've been keeping & scanning my ticket stubs, and it seemed silly to have all that data & note do owt with it... so given I needed to learn a bit about Vue.js, that seemed a neat opportunity to do something with it!

The data comes out of my Wordpress blog at https://www.jasonbstanding.com/wp-json/jbs/v2/tickets
